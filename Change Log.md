* Updated Microsoft 365 F1 EMS rights and clarified that Microsoft 365 F1 Windows does not include KMS activation.
* Added Supervision Policies to Office 365 Advanced Compliance: https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/supervision-policies
* Changed the labels for Windows Rights Management and Azure Rights Management to "Active Directory RMS" and "Azure RMS" respectively to reduce potential for confusion. This change is visible in license diagrams containing EMS E3.

* Added "Exchange Online Archiving" in Microsoft 365 Business Office 365.
* Removed Outlook Customer Manager from Microsoft 365 and Office 365 Business plans. Retiring June 2020: https://support.office.com/article/1a421cb4-e8de-4b44-bfb8-710b92820439
* Removed Invoicing from Microsoft 365 and Office 365 Business plans. Retiring February 2020: https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/invoicing/
* Renamed "Office Applications" to "Office 365 ProPlus" in Business plans to align with enterprise plan naming.
* Removed "Skype for Business Plan 2" from Business plans as since September no customer with less than 500 users is eligible for Skype for Business Online. This precludes all Business plans as they only support up to a maximum of 300 users.
* Skype for Business Online links in Enterprise plans now link to the service description to ensure customers have the latest information about the Skype for Business Online end of service: https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/skype-for-business-online-service-description/skype-for-business-online-service-description
* Fixed broken link in "PLC Groups" on Office 365 Education plans: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2016/06/20/professional-learning-community-groups-in-office-365-education/

* Renamed "System Center Config Manager" to "Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager" and updated link: https://docs.microsoft.com/configmgr/core/understand/introduction
* Added "FastTrack" to the "Microsoft 365 Enterprise Benefits" panel.
* Updated "Microsoft Managed Desktop" description to call out that "Microsoft 365 E5 Security" is the minimum license required.
* Added "Insider Risk Management (preview)" to the Microsoft E5 Compliance plan. Note: This is not part of any Office 365, EMS, or Windows plan.
* Added "Azure Information Protection for Office 365" to Office 365 E3 plans and collapsed "Office Mobile" and "Office Online" into one tile to make room on the diagrams.
* Added "Office 365 Cloud App Security" to Office 365 E5 plans. There was some confusion because this was retired as a stand-alone SKU (I.E. you cannot buy it on its own, only as part of Office 365 E5), but I've confirmed it is still part of Office 365 E5.
* Updated all Exchange Online links to a plan comparison page as the old links just redirect to Plan 1 details.
* Replaced "Office 365 ATP Plan 2" feature "Threat Explorers" link, previous link is now broken.
* Replaced Office 365 "Advanced Data Governance" link, previous link now redirects to retention policy information.

* Collapsed all references to Windows "Azure AD Join" and "Domain Join" into single "Azure AD & Domain Join" tile to create space.
* Corrected "User Experience Virtualisation" (UE-V) link, previous link was going to Windows Analytics.
* Settled on "Windows Defender Antivirus" instead of "Microsoft Defender Antivirus" when referring to the specific capability in the context of Windows licensing. "Microsoft Defender ATP" does not use the Windows naming because it grants benefits for usage on 3rd party operating systems (i.e. Mac OS).
* Replaced "Windows Defender Antivirus" link, previous link now redirects to generic Windows page.
* Added "Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP)" to rights not included in "Windows 10 E3 for Microsoft 365 F1", as per Microsoft Product Terms, January 2020.
* Changed references to Office 365 E3 "Audit Logging" to "Audit Logging & Alerting" to reflect the new alerting feature, except where a separate tile just for "Alert Policies" has been added to plans below Office 365 E3: https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/alert-policies
* Replaced "Office 365 ATP Plan 2" feature "Threat Investigation & Response" with "Automated Investigation & Response" to highlight the enhancements in this area, updated link.
* Added "1 Year Audit Log Retention" to "Office 365 Advanced Compliance".
* Renamed "Forms" to "Microsoft Forms" to highlight the product name and avoid confusion.
* Added "Microsoft Forms Pro" to "Additional Licensing" panel on Microsoft 365 Enterprise diagrams.
* Azure Active Directory Premium Plan 2 "Entitlement Management" is no longer in preview, it is now Generally Available.
* Added "Records Management" to "Office 365 Advanced Compliance" / "Office 365 E5" offerings.
* Collapsed separate PDF files down to a single file per license map type for simplicity and speed to publish.
